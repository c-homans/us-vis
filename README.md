# us-vis
This is the code for a recreational project to visualize the traffic usage of roads across the United States in d3.js (https://d3js.org). It's messy and still very much a WIP (and will be until I get around to refactoring/improving)

The raw dataset is too big to include here, but is publicly available from the U.S. Department of Transportation at 
https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/policyinformation/tables/tmasdata/ (traffic) and
https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/policyinformation/hpms/shapefiles_2017.cfm (highway shapefiles.)

A screenshot of the vis:

Two other higher-resolution screenshots are included in this directory.
