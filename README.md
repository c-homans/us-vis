This is the code I used for a recreational project to visualize the traffic usage of federal highways across the United States in d3.js (https://d3js.org). The raw data is quite large so isn't included here, but is publicly available from the U.S. Department of Transportation at 
https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/policyinformation/tables/tmasdata/ (traffic) and
https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/policyinformation/hpms/shapefiles_2017.cfm (highway shapefiles.)
